          I love making peopleâ€™s lives easier, and with technology the means are

                My passion for programming was first ignited during my final
                year as a biomedical engineering student where I built an
                affordable 3D printed prosthetic arm. I used C++ to move the
                actuators in the prosthetic hand based on EMG signals read from
                our forearms.
              </li>
              <li id="journey-list">
                This passion led me to completing a web development bootcamp at
                LighthouseLabs where I learnt coding logic using HTML, CSS &
                JavaScript and technologies like NodeJS, ReactJS and ExpressJS.
                I also learnt best practices such as TDD with tools such as
                Mocha & Chai, how to integrate relational databases such as
                PostgreSQL and software architecture to build software from the
                ground up.

            My commitment to results has given me many opportunities and here is
            a glimpse of what these experiences have taught me about myself.

                  I am a natural empath and frequently leverage empathy in
                  getting the job done. As a youth ambassador for TCHC I bridged
                  the gap between residents and TCHC employees by identifying
                  their top 3 priorities and improving the living of tenants in
                  high risk communities.

                  I enjoy working independently but teamwork really makes the
                  dream work. With the help of two lighthouse labs graduates, we
                  were able to conceptualize and develop a full stack React
                  application that helps high school students with career
                  guidance.

                  I am obsessed with learning and it has never stopped outside
                  the classroom. My learning style is a combination of reading
                  documentation, taking online courses, completing coding
                  challenges, attending workshops/conferences, reading articles
                  and watching youtube videos.

            I am a results driven person and with programming, I get to focus on
            the results. I love to think outside the box and this has given me
            the freedom to be innovative with my solutions.
          </h5>
          <h5 id="end">
            Outside of programming, I am passionate about making STEM accessible
            to everyone. I have organized a number of workshops, programs and
            conferences so please feel free to reach out if you want to chat
            about eliminating barriers in STEM.
